            <h3>8- Custom Engineering Projects</h3>
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>A Camera-Controlled Two-Axis Turret-Gun System Prototype</strong></li>
            <p>I developed a prototype to repurpose an idle military helicopter's turret-gun system for ground-based operations, commissioned by the 5th Main Maintenance Factory Directorate in Ankara. The turret-gun, repurposed and mounted on a trailer, was engineered to be controlled by a joystick manipulating a camera for target acquisition. As the camera moved to lock onto a target, the gun barrel aligned synchronously. This project integrated three TMC742 controllers and two Delta ASDA-B2 model servo drivers, enabling precise movement and control. The camera movement, coordinated in global coordinates, was driven by two stepper motor driver cards. I utilized OpenCV libraries for image processing on the PC application, C++ and Qt for the embedded software on the TMC742s, and C for programming the stepper motor driver hardware and low-level TMC742 operations.</p>
            
            <li><strong>Elevator Cabin Door Control System</strong></li>
            <p>For YenerSAN Elevator Company based in Ankara, we engineered a sophisticated elevator door control system that manages various functionalities. This system controlled a DC motor driver card to operate the doors, incorporating features such as adjustable door speed, photocell detection, and jam detection. We developed a control card, a DC motor driver card, and a battery-operated remote control device that could upload settings directly to the control card via a serial port.
